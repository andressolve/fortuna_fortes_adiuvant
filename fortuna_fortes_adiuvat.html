                            <p>Marcus balanced the basket of warm bread on his shoulder as he walked through the quiet morning streets of Rome. The sun was just rising, painting the marble temples golden. This was his favorite time of day - before the crowds, before the noise.</p>
                            
                            <p>He was delivering bread to the house of Senator Valerius, as he did every morning. The Senator was different from other wealthy Romans. He remembered Marcus's name. He always paid fairly and on time. When Marcus's father had been sick last winter, the Senator had sent his own physician to help.</p>
                            
                            <p>As Marcus approached the Senator's villa, he heard angry voices from a narrow alley. He stopped, pressed himself against the wall.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Tomorrow morning," a rough voice said. "When his cart passes through the old gate on the Via Sacra. We'll cut the wheel axle halfway through tonight. It will break on the turn, look like an accident."</p>
                            
                            <p>"And the Senator?" another voice asked.</p>
                            
                            <p>"The cart will tumble down the hill. No one will suspect anything."</p>
                            
                            <p>Marcus's heart pounded. They were planning to hurt Senator Valerius! But the voices were coming closer. He grabbed his basket and ran.</p>

                            <p>Marcus burst into his father's bakery, breathless.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Father! I heard men - they're going to hurt Senator Valerius! Tomorrow morning, they said—"</p>
                            
                            <p>His father looked up from the dough he was kneading, flour dusting his arms. "Slow down, Marcus. What men? Where?"</p>
                            
                            <p>"Near the Senator's villa. They're going to break his cart wheel!"</p>
                            
                            <p>His father's face grew serious. "Did they see you?"</p>
                            
                            <p>"No, I don't think so."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Good." His father wiped his hands. "Go tell the city guard. Quickly."</p>
                            
                            <p>Marcus ran to the guard post near the forum. A tall guard stood there, looking bored.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Please, sir," Marcus said. "Someone is going to hurt Senator Valerius! Tomorrow morning, on the Via Sacra—"</p>
                            
                            <p>The guard barely looked at him. "Run along, bread boy. The Senate has guards. They don't need warnings from children who have bad dreams."</p>
                            
                            <p>"But I heard them! Two men, they said—"</p>
                            
                            <p>"I said run along." The guard turned his back.</p>
                            
                            <p>Marcus stood there, fists clenched. No one would listen to a baker's son. But the Senator had been kind to Marcus's family. Maybe, just maybe, he would listen now.</p>
                            
                            <p>Marcus looked toward the hills where the Senator's villa stood, far across the city.</p>
                            
                            <p>He would have to be bold.</p>

                            <p>Marcus ran back to the bakery. His father was loading bread into baskets for the morning deliveries.</p>
                            
                            <p>"The guard wouldn't listen," Marcus said.</p>
                            
                            <p>His father sighed. "I was afraid of that. Well, we tried. Perhaps it was just talk."</p>
                            
                            <p>But Marcus couldn't shake the memory of those cold voices. "Father, I need to go to the Senator's villa. Now. To warn him myself."</p>
                            
                            <p>His father looked up, surprised. "Marcus, the villa is on the other side of the city - that's a long run. You have deliveries to make. And even if you get there, why would the Senator's household let a boy like you see him?"</p>
                            
                            <p>"I don't know," Marcus admitted. "But I have to try."</p>
                            
                            <p>His father studied him for a long moment. Then he nodded slowly. "The Senator helped us when we needed it. You're right - we must try to help him." He handed Marcus a special loaf, the fancy kind made with honey. "Give him this. Tell the household slaves it's a special delivery. Maybe they'll let you in."</p>
                            
                            <p>"What about the other deliveries?" Marcus asked.</p>
                            
                            <p>"I'll handle them. Go. And Marcus?" His father gripped his shoulder. "Be careful. And be brave."</p>
                            
                            <p>Marcus took the bread and ran.</p>

                            <p>Marcus ran through the waking streets of Rome. Past the fountain where the water sellers were filling their jars. Past the flower market where vendors were setting up their stalls. Past the butcher's shop where the smell of meat made his stomach growl.</p>
                            
                            <p>The forum was already getting crowded. Marcus dodged between a man carrying a crate of chickens and a woman with a basket of fish. He jumped over a stray dog. His sandals slapped against the stone street.</p>
                            
                            <p>His side began to ache, but he didn't slow down.</p>
                            
                            <p>The street narrowed. A cart blocked the way, two men arguing about who should back up. Marcus squeezed between the cart and the wall, scraping his elbow. He didn't stop.</p>
                            
                            <p>Up ahead was the gate to the wealthy district. A guard stood there - a different guard, one Marcus didn't know.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Delivery for Senator Valerius," Marcus said, holding up the honey bread and trying to catch his breath.</p>
                            
                            <p>The guard looked him up and down. "You're not the usual boy."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Special delivery. From my father's bakery. It's urgent."</p>
                            
                            <p>The guard shrugged and waved him through.</p>
                            
                            <p>Marcus ran on. His legs burned. Sweat dripped down his face. But the Senator's villa was just ahead, its white columns gleaming in the morning sun.</p>
                            
                            <p>Almost there.</p>

                            <p>At the Senator's villa, Marcus faced a tall doorkeeper with crossed arms.</p>
                            
                            <p>"I need to see the Senator," Marcus said, still breathing hard from his run.</p>
                            
                            <p>The doorkeeper frowned. "The Senator doesn't see bread boys. Leave the delivery and go."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Please, it's important. He's in danger!"</p>
                            
                            <p>"In danger?" The doorkeeper's frown deepened. "From what? A loaf of bread?"</p>
                            
                            <p>"No! I heard men planning to—" Marcus stopped. Would this man believe him any more than the guard had?</p>
                            
                            <p>But he'd come this far. He had to try.</p>
                            
                            <p>"I heard men planning to sabotage his cart," Marcus said, standing as tall as he could. "Tomorrow morning, on the Via Sacra. Please, you have to let me tell him."</p>
                            
                            <p>The doorkeeper stared at him. For a long moment, Marcus thought he would be sent away.</p>
                            
                            <p>Then a voice came from inside: "Let the boy in."</p>
                            
                            <p>The doorkeeper stepped aside. Marcus walked through the doorway into a beautiful courtyard with a fountain and flowering trees. Senator Valerius stood there in his white toga, a kind-faced man with gray in his hair.</p>
                            
                            <p>"You're the baker's son," the Senator said. "Marcus, isn't it?"</p>
                            
                            <p>"Yes, sir." Marcus was suddenly aware of how he must look - sweaty, dusty from running, his tunic stained with flour from the bakery.</p>
                            
                            <p>"You ran all the way across Rome to warn me?"</p>
                            
                            <p>"Yes, sir. I heard two men talking. They're going to damage your cart wheel tonight, so it breaks tomorrow on the Via Sacra."</p>
                            
                            <p>The Senator's expression grew grave. "Tell me everything you heard."</p>

                            <p>Marcus told the Senator everything - the voices in the alley, the plan to cut the axle, the timing. The Senator listened carefully, asking questions.</p>
                            
                            <p>When Marcus finished, the Senator called for his steward. "Send word to the city guard - my guards, not the local post. Have them watch my cart tonight. And tomorrow, prepare a different route to the Senate."</p>
                            
                            <p>The steward bowed and hurried away.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Senator turned back to Marcus. "You may have saved my life today, young Marcus. That took courage - to run across Rome, to insist on being heard when you're just a..."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Just a baker's son?" Marcus said quietly.</p>
                            
                            <p>"I was going to say 'just a boy,'" the Senator said with a smile. "But you're not 'just' anything. You saw danger and you acted. Many grown men would have done nothing."</p>
                            
                            <p>He placed a hand on Marcus's shoulder. "Do you know what we say in Latin? 'Fortuna fortes adiuvat.' It means 'fortune favors the bold.' You were bold today, Marcus. You didn't know if anyone would listen. You didn't know if you'd even reach me in time. But you tried anyway."</p>
                            
                            <p>Marcus felt his chest swell with pride.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Come," the Senator said. "You've run far enough. My slaves will give you breakfast, and then my cart will take you home. I'll be visiting your father's bakery myself this afternoon."</p>

                            <p>The next afternoon, Senator Valerius came to the bakery himself. Marcus's father nearly dropped the bread he was holding.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Senator told everyone in the busy market square how Marcus had saved him. He announced that from now on, Marcus's father would provide all the bread for the Senator's household and for his guests - a contract that would make the bakery prosperous.</p>
                            
                            <p>But more than that, he gave Marcus something else.</p>
                            
                            <p>"For your boldness," the Senator said, handing Marcus a small scroll. Marcus unrolled it carefully. On it were written the words: FORTUNA FORTES ADIUVAT.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Hang this in your home," the Senator said. "Remember that fortune favors the bold - but you must be bold first. You must act, even when you're afraid. Even when no one takes you seriously. Even when success seems impossible."</p>
                            
                            <p>Marcus looked at his father, whose eyes were shining with tears of pride.</p>
                            
                            <p>"Oh," the Senator added with a smile, "my guards found two men tampering with my cart last night, exactly as you said. They're in custody now. You were right to trust what you heard, Marcus. And I was right to trust you."</p>
                            
                            <p>As the Senator's cart rolled away through the crowded street, Marcus looked at the Latin words on the scroll. He couldn't read them perfectly yet, but he knew what they meant.</p>
                            
                            <p>Fortune favors the bold.</p>
                            
                            <p>And today, fortune had favored him.</p>
